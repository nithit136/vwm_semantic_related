    The entire experiment is rendered inside the #experiment container.  The
    JavaScript file will dynamically insert and remove elements within this
    container as the participant progresses through the task.  A simple form
    collects demographic information (participant number and age) before the
    task begins.  At the end of the experiment a download link appears
    allowing the participant (or researcher) to save the collected data as a
    JSON file.
